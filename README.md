# JavaScript30

Famous 30 days small vanilla JavaScript projects course:

For this one I tried making myself the challanges of each day on the index-START file of each project.
For most cases I was able to make myself, only watching the tutorial video later to check how the code was originally made and the differences from my code.

For some of the projects I decided to skip when realizing the learning opportunity was not intersting.
